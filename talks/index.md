These are talks that I've held on various occasions.

* __Microbiome data: what's in the bag?__ When you do a typical microbiome study you get measurements constrained to sum to a certain number (called compositional data). Is this useful? Can we cheat our way toward non-compositional measurements? Presented at CANS day, 2023. \[[slides](/pdfs/2023_CANS_microbiome.pdf)\]
* __DAGs: tools for reasoning about causes.__ A guest lecture I've given about once a semester for a couple of years on the ue of DAGs in causal inference. Most recently for the Department of Community Medicine, UiT, October, 2023. \[[slides](/pdfs/2023_dags_lecture.pdf)\]
* __Introdution to Bayesian Inference.__ Guest lecture given to the advanced epidemiology course, Dep't of Community Medicine, UiT. October, 2021. \[[slides](/pdfs/2021_intro_bayes.pdf)\]
* __Version control, &c.__
A small workshop on version control for the Dep't of Community Medicine, UiT. November 25th, 2020. \[[slides](/pdfs/251120_version_control.pdf)\]
* __Opposing forces in big data.__ On expectation propagation. Presented at the HDL lab meeting, UiT. October, 2020. \[[slides](/pdfs/2020_opposing_forces_big_data.pdf)\]
* __One weird trick to quantify uncertainty__
