<h3 id="writing-papers-and-doing-research">Writing papers and doing
research</h3>
<p>The Kajsa Møllersen u-net architecture for writing papers or <a
href="img/paper_unet.jpg">paper unet</a> for short. Certain sections are
connected across the paper (“skip connections” in the lingo) like how
basically the conclusion reflects the abstract (“we did so and so and
found so and so, etc., etc.”).</p>
<p>In paper unet methods and results are at the bottom and really they
are the basis on which a paper is built. See the <a
href="https://github.com/jtleek/firstpaper">Jeff leek guide to writing
papers</a> where the whole thing starts with doing the research and
making a handful of solid figures to write around. That is to say get
the results and write from the inside out (or the bottom up in paper
unet). Your abstract+intro are just speculation before the
methods+results are in place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-ml-paper">How to ML
paper</a> is a good guide to writing a methods type paper as well.</p>
