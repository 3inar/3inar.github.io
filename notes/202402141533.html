e04: gotta go fast</h1>
<p>This weekly update covers the last two weeks as I was simply too busy
last week. Friend of the show Kajsa was visiting our Lyngby location for
a week of focussed writing. The idea was that we have this
mostly-finished paper on the ranking of classifiers so let’s just sit
down and finish it. “Mostly finished” is a vague description, and I’m
not sure we actually made it much more finished than it was. For example
there was this quick little simulation study I wanted to do that was
neither quick nor little once I started looking at it.</p>
<h2 id="auc-is-interpretable-actually">AUC is interpretable,
actually</h2>
<p>For this simulation—work still in progress—I need to calculate a lot
of AUCs. The AUC (or <em>area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve</em> for short) used to be a completely inscrutable
statistic for me because you involve this <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#History_2">story
about radars</a> and moving some kind of decision threshold back and
forth and etc., etc., etc., etc. It’s nearly impossible to give it a
sane explanation.</p>
<p>Or so I used to think. Some years ago I learned that the AUC
<strong>does</strong> have a completely sane interpretation. You’ve got
some data that can be classified as either T or F and you have a model
that spits out a T-ness score for each data point. A higher score means
that it’s more likely that this data point belongs to class T. Could be
a probability, but it doesn’t have to be. <em>AUC is the probability
that a randomly chosen T will have a higher score than a randomly chosen
F.</em> That’s it. End of explanation. No need to invoke any curve, nor
threshold, nor hypothetical radar.</p>

<p>In numerical linear algebra it’s a folk theorem that if you’re
inverting a matrix you’re probably doing something wrong. Similarly if
you’re calculating an AUC by first building the ROC curve and then
integrating you’re probably doing it wrong. I figured this out last
week; my journey was something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I start out using <code>pROC::auc</code> in <code>R</code> because
this is what I had been doing when I didn’t need actual millions of the
things. This is very slow.</li>
<li>A little bit of searching lead me to <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4903092/calculate-auc-in-r">this
SO question</a> where <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50202118">one
of the lower-down answers</a> uses an approach from <a
href="https://blog.mbq.me/augh-roc/">this blog post</a> that’s supposed
to be pretty fast compared to <code>pROC::auc</code>, and indeed it
is.</li>
<li>But I notice that as a comment to that answer the author of the <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigstatsr/index.html"><code>bigstatsr</code>
package</a> says that they have another fast method, and indeed it is a
little faster.</li>
<li>I don’t want my son to grow up with me just staring at a progress
bar, so I want to get it a little faster still. I do some profiling and
I notice that the <code>bigstatsr::AUC</code> function <a
href="https://github.com/privefl/bigstatsr/blob/f307d297570d91127f118ce3bd4557a155057e84/R/AUC.R#L65">spends
almost half its time in sanity checks</a>. This isn’t a problem for the
size of data that <code>bigstatsr</code> is made for: the asserts will
proportionally take up no time. But for me it matters because I’m only
doing like 1000 scores at a time.</li>
<li>Luckily <code>bigstatsr::AUC</code> just calls another function
after those asserts. This function is “not exported,” but actually
<code>R</code> doesn’t enforce that. You just do
<code>bigstatsr:::AUC2</code> (notice <code>:::</code> instead of
<code>::</code>) and you access the not-exported function to skip the
sanity checks. I think the only way to speed up my simulation now is
parallelizing, which is easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both the <code>bigstatsr</code> approach and the one from the SO
answer are based on the observation that, as I say, AUC is
mathematically equivalent to a probability about ranking (see <span
class="citation" data-cites="hanley_1982">Hanley and McNeil
(1982)</span> for more). If you sort the scores it’s a really fast thing
to count pairs of T, F where the score of T is greater than the score of
F. You can do it <a
href="https://github.com/privefl/bigstatsr/blob/f307d297570d91127f118ce3bd4557a155057e84/src/AUC.cpp#L49">in
a single pass</a>. By the same approach you could in fact also build the
ROC curve in a single pass, but then you’d still have to do your stupid
little integration if AUC was what you wanted.</p>
