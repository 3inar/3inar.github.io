<h1
id="ai-generated-illustrations-have-a-striking-lack-of-intentionality">AI-generated
illustrations have a striking lack of intentionality</h1>
<p>This is most evident in those already-common articles on the web
where someone thought <em>yeah I guess we should have an image here to
draw the plebs in from social media,</em> but they had patience neither
to make one themselves, nor to make sure that it was any good.</p>
<p>These figures will often, but not always, have a very large color
gamut and throw in all kinds of colors more or less at random. They will
use contrast absolutely everywhere. (Both poor <a
href="https://drawpaintacademy.com/notan/">nōtan</a> and aggressive use
of color contrasts. A human example of such contrast is how every movie
poster uses the complimentary orange/blue combination — sorry for
opening your third eye about this.) There will be all kinds of visual
trash everywhere: almost-text, almost-math, almost-diagrams,
almost-pockets, almost-fingers, &amp;c., &amp;c. Nothing will be the
focal point because everything is a focal point. Nothing is detailed
because everything is detailed.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly saying the images are bad. They are very impressive
in the same way that generative text is: On the surface it looks like
someone worked hard on them. I might say that they are in poor taste,
but you can’t speak of taste with a random number generator. Yet it is a
problem of taste and intention. The robot had no taste nor intention
because it can’t have those things. The person who instructed the robot
clearly had no taste nor intention or they would not have used the
shitty illustration; they would have refined their prompt or the image
itself until it got better.</p>
<p>Below I made a small atrocity exhibition grabbed haphazardly from two
websites known to have edutainment type blog posts. I’m sorry for
violating your eyes with this; I’m getting a little nauseous myself
looking at the preview. But it should be clear that no human being with
any degree of intention could have made these.</p>
