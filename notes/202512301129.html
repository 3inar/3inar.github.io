<h1 id="the-year-in-reading-2024">The year in reading: 2024</h1>
<p>I write this at the end of 2025. I reckon if I were to do the year in
reading ’25 I would remember my December reading too well: my main
criteria for judging if a book was good are whether i) I can remember it
at all and ii) I still think about it. I guess a criterion iii) is
whether I hated reading it or not (see note on <strong>War and
Peace</strong> to be published in Dec. ’26).</p>
<p>I don’t include every book from ’24; only books I have something to
say about. A book isn’t necessarily bad if I leave it out.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-had-to-choose-a-favorite">If I had to choose a
favorite</h2>
<p>In terms of dry weight <strong>Musashi</strong> by Eiji Yoshikawa can
compete with any Russian classic, but it is a very pleasant read.
Perhaps part of the reason is because it is structured in shortish
“episodes” more or less. It’s anyway definitely in the “still thinking
about it” category for me.</p>
<p>Musashi’s journey from crude and primitive murderer to conscientious
and spiritually well-developed murderer makes a very good and in some
ways inspirational story. I will most likely reread this at some
point.</p>
<h2 id="good">Good</h2>
<p>I guess there isn’t so much to say about Melville’s <strong>Moby
Dick</strong>, it’s kind of well known? You might have heard about it? I
really liked it. Having read Patrick O’Brian for many years I am more or
less immune to seafaring jargon.</p>
<p><strong>The Brothers Karamazov</strong> by Fyodor Dostoevsky is also
well-known. I read it on a whim, mostly because I could get it on
Project Gutenberg and I was desperate for something to read. I expected
not to like it but I really did. I was skeptical because I read
<strong>Crime and Punishment</strong> many years ago and hated it. I
don’t think I’d have liked Karamazov in my early 20s either, but I’m
<em>not</em> revisiting C&amp;P.</p>
<p><strong>The Machinery of Life</strong> by David S Goodsell is a short
book about cell biology. It has <em>very good</em> illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong> by Donald Norman has
its main premise in the title. I think this book is at its best when
Norman rants about bad design.</p>
<p>I read two books by Nabokov, both excellent: <strong>Pale
Fire</strong> and <strong>Pnin</strong>. Pale fire is a strong contender
for the <em>If I had to choose a favorite</em> category. It’s not a
straight-forward read: it’s a long poem with the entire story hidden in
the narrator’s critical apparatus for said poem. I suspect you’d get a
lot out of rereading this one.</p>
<p>Another strong contender for <em>If I had to choose</em> is
<strong>Watership Down</strong> by Richard Adams. I don’t actually have
so much to say about it, it’s just good.</p>
<p>I read a couple of Ursula K. Le Guin collections. They were good but
I don’t remember exactly which pieces were in them. I don’t think I ever
disliked anything I read by Le Guin.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>I wanted to like Donna Tartt’s <strong>The Goldfinch</strong>. Or
rather I expected to like it, because I really liked <strong>Secret
History</strong>. But I did not like Goldfinch. It’s probably a good
book but for some reason I couldn’t care about the characters nor what
happened to them nor what happened to the Goldfinch itself.</p>
<p>Two nonfiction books:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Internet Is Not What You Think It Is</strong>, Justin E.
H. Smith. I can’t remember what the main thesis of this book is nor much
of what it said, but I still have an idea that it was interesting.</li>
<li><strong>The Mushroom at the End of the World</strong>, Anna
Lowenhaupt Tsing. It’s about Matsutake mushrooms. Seems they grow best
in forests that have been disturbed by humans. An interesting but
somehow challenging read, probably because of my own limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I reread <strong>Hogfather</strong> by Terry Pratchett in December.
It’s the only Christmas book I own. Pratchett for me is beyond good and
bad. I have read and reread the Discworld books regularly for like 20
years at this point.</p>
