# Adding Stan parsing/highlihgting/etc to nvim-treesitter

Since I just went on this adventure I figured I'd put it somewhere for the
common good; writing the blog post I wish I had three days ago.

To get `nvim-treesitter` support for Stan you need to do two things: i) find a
[parser](https://github.com/WardBrian/tree-sitter-stan) and configure
treesitter to use it; ii) add some treesitter queries for the new parser. This
all is described in 
[this post](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/treesitter-parser-in-neovim/34691/) 
on the Stan forums but I because I'm new to treesitting I needed some more
details, which I describe below:

## i) get a parser
The link above provides a Stan parser on github; you can add the repo itself as
a source for the stan parser. You need the below incantation in your nvim
config:

```lua
local parser_config = require('nvim-treesitter.parsers').get_parser_configs()
parser_config.stan = {
  install_info = {
    url = 'https://github.com/WardBrian/tree-sitter-stan',
    files = { 'src/parser.c' }, 
    branch = 'main',
  },
}

vim.filetype.add {
  extension = { stan = 'stan' },
} 
```

If, like me, you have your nvim config as vim script rather than lua you need
to wrap the above incantation in another incantation that does inline lua from
vimscript:

```vim
lua << EOF
    -- lua code goes here
EOF
```

Once this is done, reload your config and do `:TSInstall stan`.

## ii) add queries
I had no idea what was meant by this, but as it turns out what you have to do
is to copy the 
[query files](https://github.com/WardBrian/tree-sitter-stan/tree/main/queries) 
from the WardBrian repo to a place where nvim will
look for them. The simplest solution for me: `~/.config/nvim/queries/stan/`.
These files are very important as they are what treesitter use for highlighting
and such.
