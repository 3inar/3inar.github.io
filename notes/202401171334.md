# Letters from Our Lyngby Correspondent

This semester (Januaryâ€”June, 2024) I will be on a sabbatical at
[DTU in Lynbgby](https://www.dtu.dk/english/). It is my goal to provide weekly
updates on my stay. The official week is Wednesday to Wednesday, because I had
my first day in office on a Wednesday.

Why do I want to do this? Not sure! I haven't done much hands-on research the
last couple of years, having done mostly supervision, teaching, or other forms
of opinion having. This semester I will be rediscovering how to do research in
the way that I used to as a student and I think it might be interesting to have
a record of it. I believe and sincerely hope that I will be more structured
than I used to. Let's see what happens.

I started keeping a work journal after reading
[a post about someone doing it](https://www.grizzlebit.com/posts/2023/05-21-long-live-the-work-journal/). 
Mostly I write down what I have done and record interesting links, etc. Writing
things down for yourself is all well and good but I like the (highly
theoretical) idea that there is a chance someone (not an AI) will read what I
write. I have enjoyed reading the weekly logs of other people so why not?
