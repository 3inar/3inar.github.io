# Cost of rounding in a probability computation

You're making some quick computations and you don't want to fuss around with a
calculator or computer. You've got some fraction $\frac{x}{y + \epsilon}$ but
you'd much rather round it to $\frac{x}{y}$. What's the error, $\Epsilon$?

$$
\Epsilon = \frac{x}{y+\epsilon} - \frac{x}{y} 
  = x\left (  \frac{1}{y + \epsilon} - \frac{1}{y} \right )
  = x\left (  \frac{y}{y(y + \epsilon)} - \frac{y + \epsilon}{y(y + \epsilon)} \right )
  = x\left (  \frac{-\epsilon}{y(y + \epsilon)} \right ).
$$

It's reasonable to assume $\epsilon$ much smaller than $y$ so that

$$
\Epsilon \approx \frac{-x}{y^2}.
$$

So if $y$ is substantially larger than $x$ this error is quite small.

## Example
You've got 8 balls marked "1" to "8". You draw three balls, what is the
probability that "1" "2" and "3" aren't drawn? 

$$
P(\text{none of 1 2 or 3}) = 5/8\cdot 4/7 \cdot 3/6 = 5/42.
$$

Now $5/42 \approx 5/40 = 1/8 = 0.125$ with an approximate error of 
$-5/40^2 = -0.003125$. The true answer is $5/42 = 0.119047619$, so the actual error is more like
$-0.00595$. If you're busy with a poker game or some other game of chance, "one in eight" with "error roughly in the third digit" should be good enough.
