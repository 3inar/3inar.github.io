# Cost of rounding in a probability computation

Status: half-baked

You're making some quick computations and you don't want to fuss around with a
calculator or computer. You've got some fraction $\frac{x}{y + \epsilon}$ but
you'd much rather round it to $\frac{x}{y}$. What's the error, $\Epsilon$?

$$
\Epsilon = \frac{x}{y+\epsilon} - \frac{x}{y} 
  = x\left (  \frac{1}{y + \epsilon} - \frac{1}{y} \right )
  = x\left (  \frac{y}{y(y + \epsilon)} - \frac{y + \epsilon}{y(y + \epsilon)} \right )
  = x\left (  \frac{-\epsilon}{y(y + \epsilon)} \right ).
$$

Here I used to have a **wrong** approximation to the above. I'll make a good
one if I can be bothered.
