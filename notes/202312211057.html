<h1 id="hallmarks-of-generative-ai">Hallmarks of generative AI</h1>
<p>Getting more and more exposed to your GPTs, chat and otherwise, your
midjourney illustrations, etc., etc., you start noticing some
things.</p>
<p>The text generator produces text that flows very well and in certain
ways is well-written, but it has a kind of flat alien voice.</p>
<p>The image generator makes images that look very polished but broadly
gives you a similar feeling of otherness. It is more striking here
because you can often immediately tell that someone has generated their
illustration by AI, but with text it’s more of a creeping feeling.</p>
<p>This is a (perhaps) growing list of signs that your friends, family,
colleagues, or students may be secretly using generative AI.</p>
<h2 id="unwarranted-use-of-superlatives">Unwarranted use of
superlatives</h2>
<p>Friend and colleague Marko pointed this out: Nobody uses the word
“pivotal,” but ChatGPT does so <em>constantly.</em> Even the most
mundane things are pivotal to ChatGPT. Probabilistically we express this
as <span class="math inline">\(P(\mathrm{ChatGPT}|\mathrm{pivotal}) =
.99\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many years ago someone described to me one of the local journalists
as “a man of many superlatives.” So also is ChatGPT.</p>
<h2 id="an-aggressive-lack-of-intentionality">An aggressive lack of
intentionality</h2>
<p>Images generated by AI often display a stricking lack of focus and
intentionality. I have enough to say about this that I put it in a
separate note: <a
href="/notes/202403071104.html">(202403071104)</a>.</p>
<p>In my limited experience this lack of focus/intentionality also
happens for text: it is very hard to make the AI stick to a coherent
whole for anything requiring more than a handful of paragraphs.</p>
