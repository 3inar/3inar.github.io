The Metagame</h1>
<p>When I did my PhD I’d have weekly meetings with my main adviser and I
would usually say something like “well I didn’t do much since last
week.” What can you do with a week?? Depends on how hard you work I
suppose.</p>
<p>Anyway I didn’t do much since last week. I am slowly getting a vague
familiarity with relevant literature. The problem with academic
literature is that there is so very much of it. People just keep writing
papers.</p>
<p>I see people present these charts showing that the interest in
whateverology is increasing rapidly as evidenced by rapid increase in
number of whateverology papers in the databases. And I think <em>yes
that’s like every field??</em> Everyone has a chart like that! I’d like
to see those charts adjusted for the number of active researchers year
by year. My guess is that the per-researcher interest in whateverology
rarely grows rapidly, but since academia is similar to a pyramid scheme
you have to put all these new researchers somewhere.</p>
<p>While we’re discussing the metagame I was interested to read <a
href="https://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal">this
blog post</a> from the Journal of Open Source Software where they go
into what it costs them to operate and what it would cost if they relied
less on volunteers, etc. By their estimates a for-profit journal could
get by with a $140 article processing charge, which seems very
reasonable. I have paid 15 to 20 times this for the privilege of putting
a pdf online, which seems excessive. Where does the money go? Clearly
not to the reviewers.</p>
<p>I’m getting more familiar with my commute and the half-hour bike ride
now only takes me 40-45 minutes. They have these deceptive hills in some
parts of Denmark where it looks completely flat but in fact it a small
incline that goes on forever. My thighs will be <strong>very
strong</strong> after all this.</p>

Recently it was about testing for normality to check if your data meets
the assumptions for some other model. It’s considered poor
practice.</li>
