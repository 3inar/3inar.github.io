<h1 id="building-a-heap-is-on">Building a heap is O(N)</h1>
<p>You can build a heap efficiently by stuffing everything in an array
and shuffling items around until the heap property (a child is always
less than or equal to its parent) is satisfied. You do this by calling
top-down heapify first on the leaf nodes (does nothing), then on the
nodes one level up, etc etc. up to and including the root node.</p>
<p>Top-down heapify assumes everything below the root is in its place
and the root just needs to percolate down to where it belongs. A quick
analysis tells us that there are <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
items that need to be moved at most <span class="math inline">\(\log
N\)</span> steps down so the worst-case complexity is <span
class="math inline">\(O(N \log N)\)</span>, but this bound could be
tighter.</p>
<p>We can just assume that the tree is completely full since we’re doing
a big <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> analysis anyway, so let
<span class="math inline">\(N = 2^{n+1} - 1\)</span> and I won’t be
messing about with any constants, just counting the number of swaps. On
the top or <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>th level (IE at the
root) there is one subtree where we need to move the root node at most
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> spaces down. At the <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>st level there are two subtrees where we
must move the root at most <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>
spaces down, <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>, at the <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>-th level there are <span
class="math inline">\(2^{n-1}\)</span> subtrees where we need to move
the nodes at most <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> space down, and
at the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th level are the leaves,
which we don’t need to move. Summing up we need at worst to do</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k2^{n-k} =
2^n\sum_{k=1}^n k2^{-k}
\]</span></p>
<p>moves. The factor <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=1}^n
\frac{k}{2^k}\)</span> looks tricky but in fact it is bounded by a
constant. Since each term is positive we can safely say that <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{k}{2^k} \leq \sum_{k=1}^\infty
\frac{k}{2^k}\)</span>, and we can apply the tools of analysis to this
series: it converges by the ratio test. IE. if a series <span
class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\)</span> is such that <span
class="math inline">\(\lim_{n\to \infty} \left | \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}
\right |  &lt; 1\)</span> the series converges absolutely (the premium
brand convergence).</p>
<p>We could really stop here, having established that for some constant
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> it is true that <span
class="math display">\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k2^{n-k} =
2^n\sum_{k=1}^n k2^{-k} \leq c2^n = O(2^{n+1} - 1 = N).
\]</span></p>
<p>If you really wanted to you could, having shown that the limit
exists, do the common trickery of pulling out a factor <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> from the series and getting something
like the limit <span class="math inline">\(S = 2S - 2,\)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\(S = 2.\)</span> But who cares about the
constants?</p>
