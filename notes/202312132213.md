# Books

I've been using goodreads to keep track of what I read. I think I'll just stop
and track them here instead. Starting this in mid-december, 2023. The scale
is coarse: 

* ∅ — did not like or did not finish
* ⋈ — not much to say about this
* ⧑ — liked it
* ⧓ — really liked it


I link to a very short review/description.

## 2023
* ⧑ C Pam Zhang _Land of Milk and Honey_ — [review][Land of Milk and Honey]
 
### Land of Milk and Honey
Very lightly sci-fi, a fair bit of Kitchen Confidential.
