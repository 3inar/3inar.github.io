# Books

I've been using goodreads to keep track of what I read. I think I'll just stop
and track them here instead. Starting this in mid-december, 2023. The scale
is coarse: 

* no annotation — not good not bad
* ∅ — did not like or did not finish
* ☆ — liked it
* ★ — really liked it


I link to a very short review/description.

## 2023
* ☆ C Pam Zhang, _Land of Milk and Honey_ — [review][Land of Milk and Honey]
 
### Land of Milk and Honey 
A young chef gets to go to one of few places on earth that still has real
ingredients. A little bit scifi, a little bit kitchen confidential.
