# Lyngby e08: a failed experiment (season finale)

The weekly correspondent's letter is dead. Let's have a brief post mortem.

## Post mortem
I don't really want to make these updates. A weekly schedule is a a drag and
I've never really been much of a journaler. I want to update my website, and I
do like to write, I just don't want to do it like this. 

I think I will make a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) and update it
whenever I feel like. Then I can go back to writing stupid little notes to
myself as I had originally intended when redoing this website.
