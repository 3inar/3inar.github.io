# Bits of string: academic bits

### Writing papers and doing research
The Kajsa Møllersen u-net architecture for writing papers or 
[paper unet](img/paper_unet.jpg) 
for short. Certain sections are connected across the paper ("skip connections"
in the lingo) like how basically the conclusion reflects the abstract ("we did
so and so and found so and so, etc., etc."). 

In paper unet methods and results are at the bottom and really they are the
basis on which a paper is built. See the 
[Jeff leek guide to writing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/firstpaper)
where the whole thing starts with doing the research and making a handful of
solid figures to write around. That is to say get the results and write from
the inside out (or the bottom up in paper unet). Your abstract+intro are just
speculation before the methods+results are in place.

[How to ML paper](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/how-to-ml-paper) 
is a good guide to writing a methods type paper as well.

A modest proposal: I think every research group in the department (of computer
science in my case) should be forced to write at least one paper with every
other research group in the dep't.

### Teaching
NTNU has a [conversion from a 100 point scale to letter grade](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/norsk/prosentvurderingsmetoden) as follows:
```
A: 89–100 
B: 77–88
C: 65–76
D: 53–64
E: 41–52
F: 0–40
```
