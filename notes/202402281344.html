<h1 id="lyngby-e06-getting-better">Lyngby e06: getting better</h1>
<p>This week I have mostly been giving feedback on manuscripts (still
ongoing). Two PhDs have manuscripts that are mostly written, ready for
co-author feedback. A third incoming.</p>
<p>I’m working a new todo list system where I spend some time thinking
about how much time I need to do a given task and then reserving that
time in my calendar. So far it’s doing wonders for my guilty conscience.
Instead of constantly thinking about the long todo list and when I
should do all these things I can think “I’m doing it on Thursday,” if
indeed I think about it at all.</p>
<p>I read about this system in <a
href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/">this blog post
here</a>. It made a lot of sense to me because in fact it is quite close
to the system I already have (mentioned in <a
href="/notes/202401171334.html">(202401171334)</a>) where every day I
try to write down in a long <code>.md</code> what I do. The big addition
is the use of the calendar to keep the todo list, which previously I had
in a little book. Coupling the thing to be done with the time at which
to do it has a nice simplicity to it, which is important in any
discipline if I am to have any hope of maintaining it.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to figure out how to be a person with
Responsibilities. I never used to have them before. I had so few things
that I could think either <em>my friend <a
href="https://fjukstad.io/">Bjørn</a> will know what I should be
doing</em> or <em>if it’s important it’ll turn up eventually.</em> And
then I could always do the thing on short notice because I would have so
much free time. But no longer. I started suffering from Responsibilities
about the same time we had a child, and I’ve been struggling to keep up.
But it’s getting better.</p>

of the reviewer as a reader who will more carefully read your article
than the average reader</a>. Which does not necessarily mean that they
read it carefully.</li>
<li>I’ve been using vim for my R coding lately: <a
href="https://github.com/jamespeapen/Nvim-R/wiki/Use">Nvim-R works
pretty well</a>. A potential annoyance is that I might want to do other
REPLs soon and will they have the same key bindings? Of course not.</li>
