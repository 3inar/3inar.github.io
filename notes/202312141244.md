# Puzzle: Length of a line between two random points on the rim of a square

A probability puzzle I saw online somewhere and solved on a plane ride: choose
two random points along the rim of an $l\times l$ square. What is the probability
that the line connecting them is longer than $l$?

## A solution
Since a square's edge is identical to the three others we can (wlog) suppose
that the first point is on the leftmost edge. As a further simplification we
can (wlog) scale all lengths by 1/$l$ and just focus on the unit square. There
are three cases I want to condition on for the second point: i) it lands on the
same edge; ii) it lands on an adjacent edge; and iii) it lands on an opposite
edge.

There is one opposite edge and two adjacent edges, so we have
$P(\mathrm{opposite}) = P(\mathrm{same}) = 1/4,$ and 
$P(\mathrm{adjacent}) = 1/2.$ 

When both points lie on the same edge there is no probability for the line
between them to be longer than 1. On the other hand if the points are on
opposite edges there is no probability that the line between them is _shorter_
than 1. This leaves the adjacent case as the only interesting one.

For the two adjacent cases we again have a symmetry so that we can assume
(wlog) that it's the bottom edge that our second point lands on. We adopt a
coordinate system so that the lower left corner is the origin and the situation
looks like the figure below.

We're looking for the length, $x$, of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with
sides of length $p_1$ and $p_2$. These are chosen uniformly at random in
$[0,1]$. We're looking for 

$$
\begin{align*}
    P(x > 1) &= P(\sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2)} > 1) \\
             &= P(p_1^2 + p_2^2 > 1) \\
             &= 1 - P(p_1^2 + p_2^2 \leq 1).
\end{align*}
$$

This describes a very pretty geometrical situation. If we look at the unit
square comprising all possible pairs, $(p_1, p_2)$, the cases where 
$p_1^2 + p_2^2 \leq 1$ 
are exactly those inside of the quarter unit circle contained in
our unit square:

In other words $1 - P(p_1^2 + p_2^2 \leq 1) = 1 - \pi/4.$ So finally, if $L$ is
the event that the line connecting our two points is longer than 1 we have

$$
\begin{align*}
P(L)    &= \frac{1}{4}P(L | \mathrm{same})
    + \frac{1}{4}P(L | \mathrm{opposite})
    + \frac{1}{2}P(L | \mathrm{adjacent}) \\
        &= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}(1 - \pi/4) \\
        &= \frac{1}{8}(6 - \pi) \\
        &\approx 0.357.
\end{align*}
$$
