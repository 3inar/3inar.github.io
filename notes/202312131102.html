<h1 id="rebuilding-from-scratch">Rebuilding from scratch</h1>
<p>This is the third iteration of my website. In the first one I used
Jekyll and GitHub pages, with some hack-y way of doing a blog based on R
markdown documents. I moved from there to using Hugo and blogdown, which
streamlined the R markdown blog aspect a lot. However that whole process
of having an RStudio project for the site and having to launch RStudio,
etc., etc., to make even the slightest change to the site made me not
want to do updates.</p>
<h2 id="going-web-1.0">Going web 1.0</h2>
<p>I decided to rebuild the site as simply as possible, wanting to go
back to how it used to be when the internet wasn’t shit and I had a
GeoCities website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/3inar/3inar.github.io/">web 1.0</a>
version is designed to have minimal bloat. It’s all markdown that I edit
within my existing <a href="https://github.com/3inar/zett.vim">vim
workflow</a>. The site is built entirely as static <code>.html</code>
using <a
href="https://github.com/3inar/3inar.github.io/blob/master/build.py">a
python script</a> that does some light preprocessing before running <a
href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, the greatest tool known to man.
The pandoc output is then glued together with the header, menu, and
footer <code>.html</code>, these parts being the same for all pages.
adding some header and footer info. This page should work fine in raw,
unstyled <code>.html</code>; the style sheet makes only small
adjustments. You can see it’s effect on various elements on the <a
href="/meta/">meta page</a>.</p>
<p>The most complicated thing on this site is that I import <a
href="https://katex.org/">KaTex</a> to render math. I only do this
because some of the shittier browsers don’t support <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>My blog was inactive for very long periods of time because I felt
that I should make substantive posts. What I want instead is to have a
little <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden">digital garden</a>
with a lower threshold for publishing. As the link says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A collection of essays, notes, and half-baked explorations I’m always
tending to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest drawback with what I have now is that there is no system
in place for an R markdown-based posts. This isn’t because it’s hard to
implement; it’s because of the aesthetics of the resulting build
process/workflow. It just doesn’t feel <a
href="https://www.tadiweb.com/">slippy</a>. This means that I will not
bring back any R-markdown-based posts from the old blog, unless I
suddenly feel like I’m missing one. Any similar long-form content under
the current system will be more of a hand-crafted, locally sourced
thing.</p>
