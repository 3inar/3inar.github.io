# Bits of string

In Joan Didion's essay collection _Slouching Towards Bethlehem_ she describes
her notebooks as full of "bits of the mind's string too short to use." Here is a 
list of lists of bits of string.

Note: I **do not** require that whatever I put here is correct nor do I require
that it should be useful. I aim for eventual correctness and potential
usefulness with no guarantees. This is to lower the barrier for writing.

## Leftover string:

(§) An old blog post by Rafa Irizarry tells us that [lowering the GWAS threshold would save millions of
dollars](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112012243/simplystatistics.org/2017/06/20/lowering-the-gwas-threshold-would-save-millions-of-dollars/).
The point: if you accept a larger false discovery rate you get more statistical
power. It is clear that you can trade type I error for type II error and for
expensive genomics procedures perhaps the odd "false discovery" is cheaper than
sequencing more samples. Don't think that this particular concern is too
important almost 10 years later, but it is an interesting question in general:
do you want to spend money or shoeleather?
