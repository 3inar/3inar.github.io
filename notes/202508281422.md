# Bits of string: computers

(§) Let's say you have some music files on your computer and want to put them
on your iPhone _without_ using the app formerly known as iTunes: just get VLC
on your phone. Works great! In these garbage days it is nice to see that the

(§) `fd` is a more chill way of doing `find .. -exec`. The following
incantation will find all files with extension `jpg` and execute the convert
utility to convert to `(basename).png`:  

`fd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png`

[coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html)
and [moreutils](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/moreutils) both
available in homebrew. OS X provides some coreutils but not all.
