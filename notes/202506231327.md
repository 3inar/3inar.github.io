#  Bits of string: compositional data

The article [A flexible Bayesian tool for CoDa mixed models](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-024-10427-3) [@Martinez-Minaya_2024] looks promising; it frames compositional count data in a way so that it's possible to fit by using INLA. 

Dimension of of centered log ratio vectors matters. Compare $(-1, 1, 0)$ with
$(-1, 1, 0, 0, \ldots)$  (a hundred zeros repeated). The former is roughly
$(0.09, 0.67, 0.24)$ in the simplex, while the latter is roughly 
$(0.004, 0.03, 0.01, 0.01, \ldots)$, which is practically uniform. The log 
ratios between coordinates 1 and 2 (or 1 and 3) remain the same however.
