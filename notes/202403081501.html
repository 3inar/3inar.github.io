<h1 id="lyngby-e07-who-cares-what-the-computer-thinks">Lyngby e07: who
cares what the computer thinks?</h1>
<h2 id="stop-half-assing-your-illustrations-with-ai-im-allergic">Stop
half-assing your illustrations with AI, I’m allergic</h2>
<p>I don’t care about AI in the sense that I don’t find the tech
interesting and I haven’t found that much use for it in my life. It’s
more of a hindrance whenever I encounter it in the wild. Yet I spend a
lot of time thinking about it? You can’t escape other people’s use of
it, for one. I got kind of worked up about how every article on the web
and every presentation anywhere will now have an absolutely repulsive
AI-generated illustration somewhere. So I wrote a little bit about it <a
href="/notes/202403071104.html">(202403071104)</a>.</p>
<h2
id="you-dont-always-need-the-computer-to-sanctify-your-judgments">You
don’t always need the computer to sanctify your judgments</h2>
<p>I’m working with a PhD student on some data analyses and they
mentioned that they did a clustering to support the patterns they were
seeing in a figure. I wasn’t sure what to think about it. The below is
slightly edited from our email exchanges and is basically me trying to
work it out.</p>
<p><img src="img/20240308_apple_minus.png"
style="width: 50%; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>So you did your dimensionality-reducing visualization (ordination
some call it) and you notice that almost all of the data points with
property X are in a certain region of the drawing. You’re welcome to
point to that part of the drawing and say these points are all Xs. This
will be true regardless whether an algorithm identifies same pattern. If
you color all points with property X in red, and all the red is all
gathered (dare I say clustered?) in the same area, that kind of speaks
for itself. Nobody can dispute the observation that <em>all the red is
over here</em>. I’m not sure what the clustering adds in this case; if
the computer didn’t pick up on it I’d say you had the wrong
model/algorithm or something.</p>
<p>On the occasion of Tukey’s retiring from Bell Labs and from teaching
he reflects on the field of statistics and relates a cute story <span
class="citation" data-cites="tukey_1986">(Tukey 1986)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[In] 1937, when Ralph Boas was a postdoctoral student with Salomon
Bochner […] Ralph reported getting one of two answers whenever he told
Bochner his latest results: “But zees is trivial!” or “But zees is
impossible!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tukey was making a point about the practice of statistics: with
reasonable data an effect of size <span
class="math inline">\(5\sigma\)</span> is trivial to find, while
something of size <span class="math inline">\(.05\sigma\)</span> might
be nearly impossible. (And statistics is useful somewhere in between.)
The clustering of obvious clusters in my opinion falls under <em>But
zees is trivial!</em> If you can eyeball it, anyone should be able to
find it. Who cares what the computer thinks?</p>
