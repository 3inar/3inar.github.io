      <title>Comparing a relative risk to an odds ratio</title>

      <description>In connection with a meta analysis I helped with recently we wanted to compare some relative risk results from another analysis with the odds ratios that came from ours. This made me wonder to what extent the two measurements are comparable. The short story is that they aren’t generally comparable, but when dealing with small probabilities they are quite similar. The long story follows below.
Definitions Suppose we are comparing the probability of falling ill between two groups.</description>

      <title>Changing website framework from Jekyll to Hugo</title>
      <link>http://3inar.github.io/blog/2018-01-24-hugo/</link>

      <description>I decided to move away from Jekyll as a framework for running this website as I had some gemfile problems (now ruby doesn’t work at all for arcane reasons) and I figured it would be saner, simpler, and faster to just stop using something ruby-based. The switch to Hugo took a couple of hours where most of it went into (i) picking a theme and (ii) making sure the blog posts still work.</description>

      <description>A member of our lab does handwritten digit recognition in a highly structured setting. Without going into details, we want to read images of three-digit handwritten codes and recognize which number the image depicts. To avoid having to predict one of a thousand classes, we want to to split the images into three single digits.
I’m sure there are some very fancy ways indeed of doing this, but the following structure makes me think we can start with simpler solutions: (i) There are always three digits.</description>

      <title>AUC and accuracy considered harmful to model selection</title>

      <description>It’s pretty hard to build a predictive model, let’s be honest. My previous post was about the strange practice of under-/oversampling. We impose this on ourselves because we want to do yes/no classification instead of predicting probability. This post is on the same theme. It has a very clear message: if we use accuracy-like model performance measures (looking at you, AUC, F1, etc.) we reduce our ability to select the best model.</description>

      <title>Understanding undersampling</title>

      <description>I really like Frank Harrell’s blog. He writes all kinds of useful things, and as I am working in the classification/predition area I was particularly interested in his two posts about classification vs. prediction and improper scoring rules. After posting links to these in the lab Slack I got some questions that forced me to do some thinking. Why not undersample the majority class?
Possibly a motivation So the argument for balancing unbalanced classes seems to stem from the use of classification accuracy (= fraction predictions where the predicted class was correct) to evaluate classifiers: if \(.</description>

      <description>Warning from January, 2018: The statistics provided by SSB have changed a little since I made this post, for unknown reasons. Hence the text below might not be 100% accurate in terms of what the text says and what the data show. I have tried to tidy it up but I make no guarantees.
So I’m currently at a ten month reserach stay in Paris. I’m reluctant in the face of change, so I often think of home while I’m in my small apartment in a building with a slight mouse problem, or in my larger office with, astonishingly, also a slight mouse problem (unconfirmed).</description>

      <description>In my idle hours (ie when I should have been writing a paper), I came across this blog post where the author trained a neural netwok in the fine art of wine tasting. I am basically deep down a very lazy person, and from what little I understand of NNs, there are quite a few knobs to fiddle with, which really who has the time with all this untasted wine floating about?</description>
