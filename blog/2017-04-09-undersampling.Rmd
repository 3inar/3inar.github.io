I really like Frank Harrell's blog. He writes all kinds of useful things, and as 
I am working in the classification/predition area I was particularly interested 
in his two posts about [classification vs. prediction](http://www.fharrell.com/2017/01/classification-vs-prediction.html) and [improper scoring rules](http://www.fharrell.com/2017/03/damage-caused-by-classification.html). 
After posting links to these in the lab Slack I got some questions that
forced me to do some thinking. Why not undersample the majority class?

## Possibly a motivation
So the argument for balancing unbalanced classes seems to stem from the use of 
classification accuracy (= fraction predictions where the predicted class was correct) to 
evaluate classifiers: 
if $.01$ of my observations are `True`s, I'd get a $.99$ accuracy by always 
classifying as `False`. Since "everything is `False`" isn't a very sexy model,
why not make it seem as though there are more `True`s in the hope that their signal
stands out more clearly against the overwhelming mass of `False`s?

This tip that you could always try to balance your classes seems to be a piece of 
modeling folklore that everyone picks up. The way I pictured it you could just 
go ahead and balance your data by either oversampling the minority class or 
undersampling the majority class and that would be enough. After looking at
it for this post I'm no longer sure that I trust the balancing of datasets. At 
the very least it looks as though you have to do some pos hoc correction for this
balancing act, and it's probably not always well-defined how to do that.

## Let's just try
I'll simulate some data from the following logistic model: 
$$ \log \frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x,$$
$$ X\sim N(0, \sigma),$$
with $\beta_0=9, \beta_1=6,$ and $\sigma=.4$. This can easily be 
transformed into a probability of belonging to `True`:
$$p = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(9+6x)}}.$$ To generate class labels from probabilities, 
draw a uniform number $u\sim U(0,1)$ and assign to `True` 
if $u < p$. This model gives me about $600 \times$ more `False`s than `True`s. 
I will generate 100 thousand observations
from this model and fit a logistic regression to i) all the data, ii) 
a data set where I have subsampled the `False`s to get a fake 50-50 split.
```{r all_vs_undersampled}
set.seed(07042017)
b_0 <- -9
b_1 <- 6


# simulate data
x <- rnorm(100000, sd=.4)
log_odds <- b_0 + b_1*x
p_y <- 1/(1 + exp(-log_odds))
y <- factor(runif(length(p_y)) <= p_y, levels = c("FALSE", "TRUE"))

# class sizes
table(y)
table(y)[2]/sum(table(y))

# logistic regression model on full data
glm_fit <- glm(y~x, family=binomial)

# undersample F to get a 50-50 split:
class1 <- which(y=="TRUE")
class2 <- sample(which(y=="FALSE"), size = length(class1))
pseudosample <- c(class1, class2)

newx <- x[pseudosample]
newy <- y[pseudosample]

# logistic regression on undersampled data
new_glm_fit <- glm(newy~newx, family=binomial)

# compare
lim <- 2
curve(1/(1+exp(-(b_0 + b_1*x))), from = -lim, to = lim, lwd=8, col="grey", ylab = "p(True)", ylim=c(0,1))
curve(1/(1+exp(-(coef(glm_fit)[1] + coef(glm_fit)[2]*x))), lwd=1.5, from = -lim, to = lim, add=T, col="black")
curve(1/(1+exp(-(coef(new_glm_fit)[1] + coef(new_glm_fit)[2]*x))), lwd=1.5, from = -lim, to = lim, add=T, col="red")
rug(x)
```

In the above figure, the thick, grey line is the true model. The black line is 
the model estimated from all the data. It's pretty good. And it's certainly
not bad enough to make me balk at unbalanced data. The red line is from
undersampling the `False`s to get an artificial 50-50 split. We see that we
overestimate the probability of `True` a lot. It doesn't look like a super 
useful model. Clearly the proportion of `True`s in the population matters
and we just threw it away.

If we wanted to do classification we'd choose some probability threshold 
above which we'd assign everything to `True`. The standard, theoretically best 
threshold is $p=.5$. If we use this threshold under the correct model we will 
nearly always classify as `False`. That's not bad, _that's the correct
decision._ If we use this threshold under the clearly wrong undersampled model we'd 
get more predictions of `True`. Most of them would be wrong.


## What happened?
Let's do the above exercise again. This time I will do a nonparametric
regression instead of logistic regression. Specifically I want to do
Nadaraya--Watson kernel estimation (NWKE). This is helpful in this
discussion because we won't have to bend our minds around the whole logit space
vs. probability space thing of logistic regression. The NWKE
directly estimates $r(x) = E[Y|X=x]$ by a weighted average of Y around x as
follows: for observation pairs $(x_i, y_i), i\in\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$, let

$$ \hat r(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i(x)y_i, $$

where the weight of observation $i$, $w_i$, is a function of $x$. This
is very easy to reason about, it's an average of all our observations that's
weighted so that observations closer to $x$ count more. Specifically, the 
weight is defined as

$$ w_i(x) = \frac{K(\frac{x-x_i}{h})}{\sum_{j=1}^n K(\frac{x-x_j}{h})}. $$

The function $K$ is a kernel. For our discussion it's a normal 
distribution centered on $x$. The bandwidth $h$ controls the amount of influence 
points far away from x should have. For our discussion it's the standard 
deviation of our normal distribution. The weights clearly sum to 1 and they're
never negative.

```{r kernel_regression}
plot(x, jitter(as.numeric(y)),ylim=c(0.5,4.5), xlim=c(-2, 2), col="grey", ylab="", yaxt="n")
points(newx, jitter(as.numeric(newy)+2), col="grey")
lines(ksmooth(x, as.numeric(y), "normal", bandwidth = .25), lwd=1.5)
lines(ksmooth(newx, as.numeric(newy)+2, "normal", bandwidth = .5), lwd=1.5) # less data, more smoothing
```

Above I have put the full data and the undersampled data in the 
same figure along with their NWKE regressions. The $y$ values are jittered, 
they are really just zeros and ones. The top pair of clouds is the undersampled data and
the bottom pair is the full data. These regressions look a lot like our logistic
regressions from before. As before, the regression from the undersampled data greatly
overestimates the probability of `True`. Considering the form of the NWKE it
shouldn't be too surprising: the estimate at $x$ is $\sum w_i(x)y_i$, and if you remove a 
bunch of the $y_i=0$, naturally the estimate at $x$ will be larger. 
This is basically what's happening with the logistic
regression as well: there will be too few $(\hat r(x) - 0)^2$ terms in the sum of
squares that's optimized. This works both ways, you're no better off 
oversampling `True`s, you will be introducing a bunch of $1$s to inflate the estimate.

## Posterior correction
In fact, in logistic regression you get the right odds ratio anyway:
you estimate the slope, $\beta_1$, correctly in spite of having the wrong proportion of 
`True`s. You can see this in the figure, the estimated curve looks good but for
the fact that it's shifted way to the left. It's posible to correct the intercept
$\beta_0$ post hoc. This correction is $\hat \beta_0^* = \hat \beta_0 - \log(\frac{1-\tau}{\tau}\frac{\bar y}{1-\bar y})$, where $\tau$ is the proportion of `True`s in the population,
and $\bar y$ is the proportion of `True`s in your sample. I have this
from King and Zeng _Logistic regression in rare events data._ Below I apply this 
correction to our bad model from earlier:
```{r posterior_adjustment}
tau <- table(y)[2]/sum(table(y))
b_0_corrected <- coef(new_glm_fit)[1] - log((1-tau)/tau)
lim <- 2
curve(1/(1+exp(-(b_0 + b_1*x))), from = -lim, to = lim, lwd=8, col="grey", ylab = "p(True)", ylim=c(0,1))
curve(1/(1+exp(-(coef(glm_fit)[1] + coef(glm_fit)[2]*x))),lwd=1.5, from = -lim, to = lim, add=T, col="black")
curve(1/(1+exp(-(b_0_corrected + coef(new_glm_fit)[2]*x))), lwd=1.5, from = -lim, to = lim, add=T, col="red")
rug(x)
```


In spite of this clever correction the undersampled estimate is off. It still
overestimates p(`True`). In fact, the correction is consistent and its derivation is 
surprisingly simple. The estimate is worse because we threw away most of our 
data to make it.

Sure, this is a kind of ridiculous example. I'm sure no one would throw away 99 thousand
perfectly fine samples because they worry about imbalanced data, but class
balancing is a thing that people do and it's interesting to see what the implications are. As
with the logistic regression I'm sure there is some sort of post hoc correction
procedure for class balancing in many methods. 

Maybe this stuff works if you're doing something like the SVM where you
basically look at the shapes of the `True`s and the `False`s in euclidean space.
I don't know. Looking at the NWKE figure above I wouldn't be too optimistic; we
end up mussing a lot of `False`s in the critical region around
$x=.5$. Presumably the separating hyperplane would hence be (wrongy) pushed
toward the `False`s. The SVM is a pure classification algorithm and as such
intrinsically linked to the classification accuracy scoring rule. If you want a 
probability output you end up jury-rigging one by putting the distance to the 
separating plane into some sort of function at which point why not just 
estimate the probabilities directly to begin with and save yourself the grief?

## Is this ever useful?
Sure. In the case of logistic regression where the correction for undersampling
is straight-forward and theoretically sound, it could be useful. But the reasons
I can come up with aren't because it's inherently better with artificial Balanced 
Data. 

I can come up with two interesting cases. First, if you can't fit your 
data in main memory or something, and you're comfortable with  getting a less 
exact model, go right ahead.

Second, and perhaps more interesting, is an example from the world of
epidemiology and other places where case--control studies happen. Diseases are
as common as they are, they usually happen to a small fraction of all people and
you can't very well go out and create more cases. But! You can get as many healthy
controls as you can afford. Hence you can use extra controls to bolster your
estimates for the non-intercept coefficients and, if you know the prevalence of
disease in the population, you can simply adjust the intercept. That's
pretty handy.

I don't think I'd generally recommend people throw away their precious data, 
however. Though maybe you know something I don't.
