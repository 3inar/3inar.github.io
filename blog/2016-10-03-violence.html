<p><strong>Update December, 2020: This post was too much hassle to maintain: its build would break every now and again with updates from the Central Bureau of Statistics. If you want this analysis I point you to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07654">article I wrote with Vittorio Perduca</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/3inar/crime_rates">GitHub repo</a></strong></p>
