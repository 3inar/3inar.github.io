# Useful or interesting links

Just a list of web places I like. Building it over time so stop by later if
it's short.

* Steele's rant on [advice for graduate students in statistics](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Rants/AdviceGS.html).
  The focus is on statistics, but the advice is broadly applicable.
* [References to dispel common statistical misconceptions](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/reference-collection-to-push-back-against-common-statistical-myths/1787). 
    Go there to see if you have some misconceptions or to prove that someone
    else has some.
