# Useful or interesting links

Just a list of web places I like. Building it over time so stop by later if
it's short.

* Steele's rant on [advice for graduate students in statistics](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/Rants/AdviceGS.html).
  The focus is on statistics, but the advice is broadly applicable.
* [References to dispel common statistical misconceptions](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/reference-collection-to-push-back-against-common-statistical-myths/1787). 
    Go there to see if you have some misconceptions or to prove that someone
    else has some.
* [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/) is an artist collective run out of a
  boat. They have really interesting computer science ideas about adapting
  computing to boat life where connections are bad and power is limited. Do
  read the essay on 
  [weathering software winter](https://100r.co/site/weathering_software_winter.html) 
  and the one on 
  [computing and sustainability](https://100r.co/site/computing_and_sustainability.html). Made me want to make up my own virtual machine as well.
