<p>I decided to move away from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as a framework for running this website as I had some gemfile problems (now ruby doesn’t work at all for arcane reasons) and I figured it would be saner, simpler, and faster to just stop using something ruby-based. The switch to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> took a couple of hours where most of it went into (i) picking a theme and (ii) making sure the blog posts still work.</p>
<p>The great thing about this switch is that I can now use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">Blogdown</a> package to render the posts with R code in them. I’m so far very happy with this, my old workflow was very hacky, and I could never remember how to run the local Jekyll server. Blogdown simply renders on save and even shows a site preview directly in RStudio.</p>
