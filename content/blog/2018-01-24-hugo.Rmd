I decided to move away from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as a framework for
running this website as I had some gemfile problems (now ruby doesn't work at
all for arcane reasons) and I figured it would be saner, simpler, and faster to
just stop using something ruby-based. The switch to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
took a couple of hours where most of it went into (i) picking a theme and (ii)
making sure the blog posts still work.

The great thing about this switch is that I can now use the excellent
[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package to render the posts
with R code in them. I'm so far very happy with this, my old workflow was very
hacky, and I could never remember how to run the local Jekyll server. Blogdown
simply renders on save and even shows a site preview directly in RStudio.
