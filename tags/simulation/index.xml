      <description>It’s pretty hard to build a predictive model, let’s be honest. My previous post was about the strange practice of under-/oversampling. We impose this on ourselves because we want to do yes/no classification instead of predicting probability. This post is on the same theme. It has a very clear message: if we use accuracy-like model performance measures (looking at you, AUC, F1, etc.) we reduce our ability to select the best model.</description>

      <description>I really like Frank Harrell’s blog. He writes all kinds of useful things, and as I am working in the classification/predition area I was particularly interested in his two posts about classification vs. prediction and improper scoring rules. After posting links to these in the lab Slack I got some questions that forced me to do some thinking. Why not undersample the majority class?
Possibly a motivation So the argument for balancing unbalanced classes seems to stem from the use of classification accuracy (= fraction predictions where the predicted class was correct) to evaluate classifiers: if \(.</description>
