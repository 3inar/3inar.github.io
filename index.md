I am a Ph. D. student at [UiT – The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no/). I am currently working on predictive modelling of gene expression data from the [Norwegian Women and Cancer](https://site.uit.no/nowac/) study. I'm a member of the [Biological Data Processing Systems](http://bdps.cs.uit.no/) lab; I'm also a member of the [EPINOR](http://site.uit.no/epinor/) research school. I have my co-supervisor Etienne Birmelé at the [MAP5 lab at l'université Paris Descartes](http://map5.mi.parisdescartes.fr/), where I did a ten-month reserach stay 2016-2017.
