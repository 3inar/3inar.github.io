I am a Ph. D. student at [UiT â€“ The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no/). I am currently working on classification of gene expression data from the [Norwegian Women and Cancer](https://site.uit.no/nowac/) study. I'm a member of the [Biological Data Processing Systems](http://bdps.cs.uit.no/) lab; I'm also a member of the [EPINOR](http://site.uit.no/epinor/) research school. My main interests are machine learning, statistics, and distributed/parallel computing.
