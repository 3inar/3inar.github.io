# Einar Holsbø 
I am a researcher/teacher/opinion haver. Formally this is called an academic. I
am currently an Associate Professor at the University of Tromsø, affiliated
with [CANS](https://uit.no/research/cans) and
[HDL](https://uit-hdl.github.io/). During my PhD I focussed on some practical
problems of predictive models for -omic data, particularly transcriptomics. I
am interested in statistics, the Reverend Bayes, causal inference, computer
science, mathematics, etc. 

## Writing
Apart from listing my research and similar I use this site to publish little
notes and other writing. It's disorganized. Take a look at the [notes](notes/)
or possibly the Bits of String [[202508181349]].

Here are some perhaps more coherent things:

* [[202502271941]] Making a heap is $O(N)$.
* [[202405281202]] PCA is OK (or the Davis-Kahan $\sin \theta$ theorem)
* [[202403071104]] AI-generated illustrations are bad, actually.
* [[202401171334]] Handful of blog posts from the Technical University of Denmark.
* [[202312132213]] List of books I read.
* [[202312131102]] On rebuilding this site from scratch to be more `web 1.0`.
