# Website of Einar Holsbø, PhD.
Currently I am an Associate Professor at the University of Tromsø, affiliated
with [CANS](https://uit.no/research/cans) and
[HDL](https://uit-hdl.github.io/). I did my phd on modeling gene expression
data. My professional interests include data analysis, statistics, a little bit
of mathematics, computer science, etc.

Note however that this is not strictly a professional site.

# Writing
I like to write. For technical reasons many of the links internally in this
site are only timestamps to when the document was first created, but I
helpfully provide a description next to the link itself.
