# Einar Holsbø 
I am a researcher/teacher/opinion haver. Formally this is called an academic. I
am currently an Associate Professor at the University of Tromsø, affiliated
with [CANS](https://uit.no/research/cans) and
[HDL](https://uit-hdl.github.io/). During my PhD I focussed on some practical
problems of predictive models for -omic data, particularly transcriptomics. I
am interested in statistics, the Reverend Bayes, causal inference, computer
science, mathematics, etc. 

## Writing
Apart from listing my research and similar I use this site to publish little
notes and other writing. Here are some links to some things I wrote. For
technical reasons many of the links internally on this site timestamps to when
the document was first created, but I helpfully provide a description next to
the link itself.

* [[202401171334]] Almost-weekly blog posts from my current research stay at
  the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby.
* [[202312132213]] List of books I read.
* [[202312131102]] On rebuilding this site from scratch to be more `web 1.0`.
