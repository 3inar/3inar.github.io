# Website of Einar Holsbø, PhD.
Currently I am an Associate Professor at the University of Tromsø, affiliated
with [CANS](https://uit.no/research/cans) and
[HDL](https://uit-hdl.github.io/). I did my phd on modeling gene expression
data. My professional interests include data analysis, statistics, a little bit
of mathematics, computer science, etc.

Note however that this is not strictly a professional site.

## Writing
Here I highlight some things I wrote (but there isn't so much content yet). For
technical reasons many of the links internally on this site are only timestamps
to when the document was first created, but I helpfully provide a description
next to the link itself.
