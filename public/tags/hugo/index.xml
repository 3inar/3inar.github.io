      <description>I decided to move away from Jekyll as a framework for running this website as I had some gemfile problems (now ruby doesn’t work at all for arcane reasons) and I figured it would be saner, simpler, and faster to just stop using something ruby-based. The switch to Hugo took a couple of hours where most of it went into (i) picking a theme and (ii) making sure the blog posts still work.</description>
